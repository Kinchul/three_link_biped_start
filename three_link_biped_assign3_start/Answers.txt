Q1: Why do we need to update r0?

    The equations of movements are solved in a reference frame fixed to the
    stance foot of the biped and it is displayed starting from this position. 
    Since the stance foot changes for each step, it is required to set the 
    position where the visualization starts to the impact point of the swing 
    foot that will become the stance foot after impact. 

Q2: What does a real time factor of 1 mean ? How about a real time factor 
smaller than 1? How does 'skip' effect this value?

    t_anim (obtained with tic/toc) is the time the simulation takes to be 
    displayed. The final time contained inside the struct sln is the time in
    which the simulation "really" occured.

    A factor 1 means that the simulation is running at the same time as what
    we see it on the screen. 
    If it is smaller (which is the case with our test computer, with a value
    around 1/4) it means that the computer plotted the simulation slower than
    it really occured. In our case, the simulation is seen 4 times slower.

    The 'skip' parameter set how many step from the solution are skipped 
    during the animation i.e. if skip is 5, it animate.m will display every
    5th step and if skip is 1, it will display every computed step.
    This means that with a lower 'skip', more steps are vizualised, which 
    takes more time and therefore increases t_anim and decreases the real 
    time factor.
    For example, using a 'skip' of 2 gives a sort of slow-motion simultaion 
    with a real time factor around 0.15, while a 'skip' of 8 gives an 
    accelerated simulation with a real time factor of 0.45.
